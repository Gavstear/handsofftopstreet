  <h2>Cameron Homes</h2>
      <p>
        Cameron Homes is a Midlands-based housebuilder known for targeting semi-rural and village-edge locations. While they promote themselves as a quality developer, past experiences have raised concerns about their reliability and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a previous development at Lea Castle Village (Kidderminster), Cameron Homes was served with a Temporary Stop Notice by the local authority due to unauthorised construction activities and a failure to deliver essential flood mitigation works. This breach undermined public trust and resulted in complaints from residents about inadequate consultation and disruption during the build phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their current proposal for Appleby Magna has also raised serious questions about transparency, given that the first public notice arrived via leaflet just days before a limited-time drop-in exhibition, providing minimal opportunity for meaningful engagement.
      </p>

      <h2>Evolve Planning</h2>
      <p>
        Evolve Planning is a consultancy firm that works with developers across the UK. They specialise in securing planning permissions for edge-of-settlement and greenfield sites, often in areas where development is contentious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their approach typically involves an early public engagement strategy via online feedback forms and exhibitions — methods which some communities feel are designed more to pre-empt objections than to genuinely consult. Their projects have included controversial schemes in Bedfordshire, Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire, where opposition has been strong and decisions were sometimes overturned on appeal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the planning refusal history of the Appleby Magna site, and the past issues tied to both Cameron Homes and Evolve Planning, residents have justifiable concerns about the impact of this development and the trustworthiness of those behind it.
      </p>
<h2>Cameron Homes</h2>
  <p>
    Cameron Homes is a Midlands-based housebuilder with a focus on semi-rural and village-edge locations. While they market themselves as a quality developer, there have been past incidents that raised public concern.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Lea Castle Village (Kidderminster), Cameron Homes was served with a Temporary Stop Notice (TSN) by Newark & Sherwood District Council for unauthorised works on a separate development site. These included commencing work on highways without S278 approval, creating an unauthorised access road, operating without a wheel-wash facility, and failing to protect trees adequately. This led to formal complaints from residents and undermined community confidence in the developer’s practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Appleby Magna, the first notice to residents regarding their current proposal arrived via leaflet on 28 May 2025, just days before a limited-time drop-in event. Many locals felt this provided inadequate opportunity for meaningful consultation and raised questions about transparency.
  </p>

  <h2>Evolve Planning</h2>
  <p>
    Evolve Planning is a UK-based consultancy that works closely with developers to secure planning permission, particularly on greenfield and edge-of-settlement sites. Their involvement in schemes across Bedfordshire, Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire has sometimes drawn strong community opposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evolve typically conducts online consultations and limited exhibition sessions early in the process. While framed as public engagement, these approaches have been criticised by some as offering limited room for genuine community dialogue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although direct controversies tied to Evolve Planning are less well-documented in mainstream press, their recurring role in contentious developments highlights a pattern that raises concerns among rural communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given the planning refusal history of the Appleby Magna site and past accountability issues linked to Cameron Homes, residents have raised valid concerns about the transparency and long-term intentions of those behind this proposal.
