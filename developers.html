  <h2>Cameron Homes</h2>
      <p>
        Cameron Homes is a Midlands-based housebuilder known for targeting semi-rural and village-edge locations. While they promote themselves as a quality developer, past experiences have raised concerns about their reliability and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a previous development at Lea Castle Village (Kidderminster), Cameron Homes was served with a Temporary Stop Notice by the local authority due to unauthorised construction activities and a failure to deliver essential flood mitigation works. This breach undermined public trust and resulted in complaints from residents about inadequate consultation and disruption during the build phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their current proposal for Appleby Magna has also raised serious questions about transparency, given that the first public notice arrived via leaflet just days before a limited-time drop-in exhibition, providing minimal opportunity for meaningful engagement.
      </p>

      <h2>Evolve Planning</h2>
      <p>
        Evolve Planning is a consultancy firm that works with developers across the UK. They specialise in securing planning permissions for edge-of-settlement and greenfield sites, often in areas where development is contentious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their approach typically involves an early public engagement strategy via online feedback forms and exhibitions â€” methods which some communities feel are designed more to pre-empt objections than to genuinely consult. Their projects have included controversial schemes in Bedfordshire, Warwickshire, and Oxfordshire, where opposition has been strong and decisions were sometimes overturned on appeal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the planning refusal history of the Appleby Magna site, and the past issues tied to both Cameron Homes and Evolve Planning, residents have justifiable concerns about the impact of this development and the trustworthiness of those behind it.
