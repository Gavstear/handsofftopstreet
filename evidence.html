         <h2>Planning History</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed site off Top Street has already been subject to a planning application by Bloor Homes (Ref: 14/00082/OUTM), which was refused by North West Leicestershire District Council. The reasons included the site being outside the Limits to Development, significant harm to landscape character, and poor integration with the villageâ€™s historic setting. None of these concerns have been adequately addressed in the new proposal by Cameron Homes.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Plan and Preferred Sites</h2>
      <p>
        The Local Plan identifies site AP1, near Steeple View Lane, as the preferred location for any new housing development. The Top Street site is not allocated for development. Granting permission would undermine the integrity of the Local Plan and the democratic planning process.
      </p>

      <h2>Environmental and Heritage Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The site borders the Appleby Magna Conservation Area and is part of a valued landscape that contributes to the village's character and heritage setting.</li>
        <li>Local wildlife and biodiversity would be permanently impacted, with no clear plan for mitigation.</li>
        <li>Views across open countryside would be lost, impacting the setting of nearby heritage assets, including medieval open fields.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Developer Track Record</h2>
      <p>
        Cameron Homes has been subject to planning enforcement measures, including a Temporary Stop Notice for failure to implement promised flood alleviation and other mitigation during past developments. This raises serious concerns about the reliability of their future commitments.
      </p>

      <h2>Community Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Residents received notice of the proposal via a leaflet just days before the developer's drop-in exhibition on June 5, 2025. Many feel the consultation was inadequate and timed to limit public awareness and input.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further evidence is being gathered via drone surveys, photographic records, and resident testimonies to document the value and importance of this site to the local community.
